		<h1>Jess J Design's</h1>
		<p>Hello! My name is Jessica Johnson. As a designer I love to challenge myself, to push ideas beyond the norm and explore new ways of thinking and doing. I believe that the integrity and success of design depends heavily on the attention given to the details therein, and this is what I try to achieve in every design. Because good design makes you smile!</p>
